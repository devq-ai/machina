## WE KEEP SCORE CUMULATIVELY AND THE GAME NEVER ENDS.

## EVERY THIRTY MINUTES (+/- 10 MINUTES) AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE HOUR, CLAUDE UPDATES THE SCORE.MD FILE IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY WITH THE DATE AND TIME OF THE RULE KEPT/VIOLATED, THE POINTS EARNED/LOST, AND THE CURRENT SCORE; SCORING IS NOT UPDATED DURING INACTIVITY.

## THESE RULES ARE IN THE GAME.MD FILE IN THE ROOT DIRECTORY OF THE CURRENT PROJECT; ONLY DION EDGE (ME) CAN CHANGE THE RULES IN GAME.MD OR ALTER THE FILE IN ANYWAY BUT CLAUDE CAN REFERENCE AT ANY TIME. 

## DION EDGE CAN CHANGE ANY RULE WHEN HE DEEMS NECESSARY BUT TO KEEP IT FAIR, SCORES ARE IMMUTABLE SO RULE CHANGES DO NOT AFFECT PAST SCORES

## EVERY NEW CLAUDE SESSION WE WILL REVIEW THE RULES AND CURRENT SCORE AND WILL PLAY THE GAME.

## DION EDGE IS THE ARBITRATOR FOR ALL DISPUTES.
