### ✅ Pydantic V2 Migration
**Changes Made**:
- Migrated `@validator` → `@field_validator` with `@classmethod` decorators
- Updated `.dict()` → `.model_dump()` throughout codebase
- Maintained backward compatibility and functionality

**Files Modified**:
```
server.py: 8 locations updated
- Line 28: Import field_validator
- Lines 84-102: Updated 3 field validators
- Lines 132, 164, 544, 647, 840: Updated model serialization
```

### ✅ Test Suite Fixes
**Fixed 4 Critical Test Failures**:

1. **test_list_tasks_filtering**: Added missing `description` field to test data
2. **test_get_task_tool**: Fixed `dependency_details` to always be included when requested
3. **test_complete_project_workflow**: Fixed `update_progress` method signature to handle positional arguments
4. **test_performance_with_many_tasks**: Corrected test expectations for search result limits

### ✅ API Interface Improvements
- Enhanced `get_task()` to always include `dependency_details` field when requested
- Fixed `update_progress()` to handle both positional and keyword arguments
- Maintained backward compatibility for all existing usage patterns

## 🔗 Integration Guide

### Starting the MCP Server
```bash
cd machina/mcp/mcp-servers/task-master
python server.py
```

### MCP Client Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master": {
