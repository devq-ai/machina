"""
HTTP Routes Package for Machina Registry Service

This package contains the FastAPI HTTP REST API route definitions for the
Machina Registry Service. The routes are organized by functionality and
provide comprehensive endpoints for service discovery, health monitoring,
and configuration management.

Note: This is a placeholder implementation for subtask 1.1. Full route
implementations will be added in subsequent subtasks as the database
and service layers are implemented.

Modules:
- registry.py: Registry service discovery and management endpoints
- health.py: Health monitoring and status endpoints
- config.py: Configuration management endpoints
- __init__.py: Route aggregation and FastAPI router setup
